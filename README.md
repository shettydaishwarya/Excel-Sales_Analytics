# Sales Report

**Project Overview:**

This project is a Sales Analytics Excel Report designed to provide insights into business performance across customers and markets. It includes two detailed reports built using Excel formulas, pivot tables, and interactive visuals.

The goal of this project is to help stakeholders quickly understand sales trends, customer performance, and how different markets are performing compared to their targets.

**Reports Included**

**1. Customer Net Sales Performance Report** (https://github.com/shettydaishwarya/Excel-Sales_Analytics/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)

**Role of the Customer Net Sales Performance Report**

The Customer Net Sales Performance Report plays a crucial role in helping businesses understand how each customer contributes to overall sales growth. This report provides a detailed year-over-year comparison of customer sales and highlights performance trends that support informed decision-making.

**Key Roles of This Report**

**1. Identify High-Value Customers**

The report shows net sales for each customer across multiple years.

This helps the business:
  1. Recognize top-performing customers (e.g., Amazon, AtliQ e-Store)
  2. Prioritize strategic accounts
  3. Allocate resources and support to high-impact customers

**2. Track Year-over-Year Growth**

The “21 vs 20” % growth column highlights how each customer’s sales changed compared to the previous year.
This helps identify:
  1. Customers with strong growth momentum
  2. Customers showing decline or stagnation
  3. Trends that may require attention or intervention

**3. Evaluate Customer Engagement and Market Potential**

By analyzing multi-year sales, the company can:
  1. Understand long-term customer behavior
  2. Assess whether customers are expanding, stable, or reducing orders
  3. Forecast future business opportunities

**4. Support Sales & Strategic Planning**

Sales leaders can use this report to:
  1. Set future sales targets
  2. Develop customer-specific strategies
  3. Tailor marketing and promotional efforts
  4. Improve negotiations with key customers

**5. Enable Performance Comparison Using Filters**

The report includes filters such as:

  **1. Region**
  **2. Market**
  **3. Division**

These filters allow stakeholders to:

  1. Drill down into performance for specific business segments
  2. Compare customers across regions or markets
  3. Obtain more focused insights for decision-making

**6. Visualize Performance Quickly**

The use of:
  1. Color-coded cells
  2. Highlights for high/low sales
  3. Clear percentage performance metrics

…makes it easier to identify performance patterns at a glance, improving the speed and quality of analysis.

**7. Detect Risks and Opportunities Early**

By spotting sudden drops or extreme growth rates, the report helps the organization:
  1. Investigate causes (market changes, supply issues, competitor impact)
  2. Plan recovery for declining customers
  3. Leverage high-growth customers to expand business

**2. Market Performance vs Target Report** (https://github.com/shettydaishwarya/Excel-Sales_Analytics/blob/main/Market%20Performance%20vs%20Target%20Report.pdf)

**Role of the Market Performance vs Target Report**

The Market Performance vs Target Report is designed to evaluate how each market (country) is performing relative to the organization’s sales targets. 
It helps businesses understand where they are meeting expectations, where they are falling short, and what corrective actions may be needed.

**Key Roles of This Report**

**1. Measure Market Performance Against Targets**

This report compares actual 2021 sales with 2021 targets for each country.
It clearly highlights:
  1. Markets achieving targets
  2. Markets underperforming (shown using red-colored % values)
  3. Magnitude of the positive or negative variance
     
This helps leadership easily identify which regions need attention.

**2. Identify Underperforming Markets**

The "% (percentage difference)" column makes it easy to spot markets that are significantly below target.

This helps evaluate risk areas where sales strategies may be failing or where external factors are impacting performance.

**3. Track Multi-Year Market Sales Trends**

The report includes sales data for:
  1. 2019
  2. 2020
  3. 2021

This enables the business to analyze:
  1. Whether growth is consistent
  2. If a market’s shortfall is due to recent decline or long-term issues
  3. Which countries show strong sales progression despite missing the target

**4. Support Regional Strategy and Resource Allocation**

By understanding the performance of each market, the business can make better decisions such as:
  1. Realigning market-wise sales targets
  2. Redirecting marketing budgets
  3. Strengthening operations in high-potential markets
  4. Reviewing distribution channels for underperforming regions

**5. Simplify Analysis With Filters**

The report includes filters for:
  1. Region
  2. Division

These allow users to:
  1. Drill down into performance by specific business segments
  2. Compare targets and performance across different divisions
  3. Tailor the analysis to leadership or functional teams

**6. Provide a Visual, Easy-to-Interpret Performance Summary**

Using color coding (yellow for actuals, red for negative %), the report visually highlights:
  1. How far each country is from its target
  2. Trends that need immediate attention
  3. Countries performing close to targets

This improves decision-making speed and accuracy.

**7. Enable Performance Review & Forecasting**

The insights from this report help in:
  1. Annual sales reviews
  2. Target setting for next year
  3. Adjusting forecasts
  4. Strategic planning for expansion or corrective action
